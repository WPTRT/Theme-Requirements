Placeholder/default images for posts without defined featured images need to follow these rules:

be generic (solid color, gradient or patterns)

they can’t display logos

they can’t display text, only accepted form would be displaying the image size, 400x300px

icons are allowed as long as they are not logos. A good example is a photo camera icon

they need to be bundled within the theme, don’t use third-party placeholder services directly (e.g: placeholder.com).
