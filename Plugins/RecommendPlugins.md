Themes may recommend plugins from WordPress.org

Themes may only use TGM Plugin Activation or similar libraries to recommend and install plugins that
are hosted on WordPress.org (by using 'required' => false for each plugin)

Themes may recommend GPL compatible plugins that are not hosted on WordPress.org in the readme file 
or the themes information page but may not include a direct link to the download for security reasons.
You can link to the product page for the recommended plugin, but not directly to the download file.
