<h4>Skip links</h4>

Themes must include a mechanism that enables users to navigate directly to content or navigation on entering any given page. 

These links may be positioned off-screen initially but must be available to screen reader users and must be visible on focus for sighted keyboard navigators.



A minimally conforming skip link must:

Be the first focusable element perceived by a user via a screen reader or keyboard navigation

Be visible when keyboard focus moves to the link

Move focus to the main content area of the page when activated

Note that this only applies if there is something to skip past, 

such as a menu or larger header section or secondary widget area before the main content.
